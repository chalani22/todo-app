Correctness

My application meets the core functional requirements of the assignment by implementing a complete Todo workflow, creation, view, update, delete, along with strict ABAC enforcement for the three roles: user, manager, and admin. The authorization rules are enforced server-side in the API routes so that the system cannot be bypassed from the UI. A normal user can only access their own todos, create new todos, update their own todos, and delete only their own todos when the status is draft. A manager can view todos across all users but cannot create, update, or delete. An admin can view todos across all users and can delete any todo irrespective of status, while being restricted from create and update. These rules exactly align with the required access-control behavior, and the UI actions are consistent with the backend permissions to avoid any incorrect operations.

Code Quality

The codebase uses Next.js App Router conventional practices and properly segregates concerns between UI, API, authentication, and data access. Authentication has been handled by integrating a single Better Auth config, Prisma for accessing databases, and ABAC policies written at the API level so that no business logic spills into components for authentication and policies. React Query has been applied for server state management (fetching, caching, and refetching data) in a consistent and readable way for code improvement and easier extensibility (for instance, adding more features or attributes at a later stage). Handling of common UI elements, for example, buttons, has been properly maintained by shadcn/ui files that ensure clean and consistent UI code.

UX

The application has been developed to offer an easy, straightforward user experience. The authentication process is straightforward, and the interface will assist users in creating and maintaining their To-Dos. The Login and Registration pages have been consistently designed using shadcn/ui materials, and they provide the user with professional-looking pages and instantaneous visual feedback during load and error processes. The To-Do page is clearly divided into three parts: the create form, the list view, and the edit mode; React Query refetches/invalidation show instant feedback to the user after performing an action. The user interface considers many different roles; therefore, if an action is not valid for a given role, it is either hidden or greyed out to prevent confusion for the user and to reduce the need for security checks against the server. Ultimately, clean designs with clarity and minimal friction enable users to quickly complete their tasks.

Understanding of Concepts:

This project highlights my comprehension of the ABAC concept, as well as my ability to build an application that follows an ABAC model. I built an application that allows users to make authorization decisions based on 3 different types of attributes: 1) authenticated users' roles; 2) authenticated users' ownership of todos 3) todos' statuses (i.e., whether a todo item is active or inactive). My policies incorporate contextual attributes to expand the set of available attributes for authorization decision-making beyond just roles. For example, a user may only delete a todo item if they are the owner of that todo item and the todo item is in draft status; however, an administrator could delete any todos, regardless of ownership or status. It is also important to note that all of the authorization rules are enforced at the API Layer, which is considered the secure boundary of the application. As a result, the application can implement authorization rules on the frontend and will still enforce these same rules even if a user modifies the frontend. Thus, the backend will remain the source of truth with respect to authorization and the frontend will only reflect what the backend allows. Therefore, this solution demonstrates an understanding of both creating secure authorization and implementing this solution using modern web application technology stacks.
